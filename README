Things that need to be done for Baxter

More testing!

- Everything is now in Moveit
-- How can we use the "both_arms" group? - Done
-- Need to speed up trajectories. Can rescale trajectories like guy in  moveit users group
--- Can check if trajectories are based on joint limits in moveit_config, they are. Which RDF do we use? SRDF/URDF or joint_limits.yaml?

- Maybe replace crane game with memory game for now

-More modular? Crane prep and crane-go modes for example?

- Weird slow-down mode, other issues with skeleton tracker. Need a way to start it up right if it doesn't start up.



Longer-term
Smarter handling of Kinect
-Shut down kinect or skeleton tracker entirely if no one is nearby
-Use headcam or other webcam to detect changes in scene (a.k.a.) people nearby
-Then start back up, only do "full restart" of kinect if skeleton tracker won't start up properly

Smarter shutdowns at night
-Run a chron job to shutdown everything at night and start everything in the morning
