Set up sudo service udev reload to run without sudo

Check if skeleton tracker is starting up properly
-Starting to do this now
-- Need to constantly print that output I think...

Update "baxter sleeping" image

Crane game with Cartesian space controls and orientation DOWN, no roll, 90degree down pitch, no yaw.

- Maybe replace crane game with memory game for now

- More modular? Crane prep and crane-go modes for example?

- Weird slow-down mode, other issues with skeleton tracker. Need a way to start
  it up right if it doesn't start up.


Longer-term
Smarter handling of Kinect
-Shut down kinect or skeleton tracker entirely if no one is nearby
-Use headcam or other webcam to detect changes in scene (a.k.a.) people nearby
-Then start back up, only do "full restart" of kinect if skeleton tracker won't start up properly

Smarter shutdowns at night
-Run a chron job to shutdown everything at night and start everything in the morning
