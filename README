Things that need to be done for Baxter

Adam-
Fix shutdown and restart of kinect
-May need to include something to check if the skeleton tracker can't start up properly. It may also just reset on its own, not sure.

Adam-
Meta-mode controller
- Set up. Needs to be written into other files.
- Written into tracker_heartbeat.py. Needs to be incorporated into baxter_controller.py (this will be the hardest to undertake)

Jon-
"Low-Pass filter" for hand raise to trigger baxter
-Wait ~0.5-1s and see if hand is raised the whole time

Jon-
Have motors turn off in a 'better' position

Jon-
Speed up process of getting into each demo
-Arms move at the same time
-Remove 'clicking' of gripper etc

Longer-term
Smarter handling of Kinect
-Shut down kinect or skeleton tracker entirely if no one is nearby
-Use headcam or other webcam to detect changes in scene (a.k.a.) people nearby
-Then start back up, only do "full restart" of kinect if skeleton tracker won't start up properly

Smarter shutdowns at night
-Run a chron job to shutdown everything at night and start everything in the morning
