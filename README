Things that need to be done for Baxter

More testing!

Run this command to get the correct URDF,
fork the moveit repo and update it with the changes I've made.
rosparam get -p /robot_description | tail -n +2 > baxter.urdf

May be an issue with using the _gripper_base jiont or link

Also, use IKFast plugins instead of KDL solver?

Make sure to set goal tolerance

- Maybe replace crane game with memory game for now

- More modular? Crane prep and crane-go modes for example?

- Weird slow-down mode, other issues with skeleton tracker. Need a way to start
  it up right if it doesn't start up.


Longer-term
Smarter handling of Kinect
-Shut down kinect or skeleton tracker entirely if no one is nearby
-Use headcam or other webcam to detect changes in scene (a.k.a.) people nearby
-Then start back up, only do "full restart" of kinect if skeleton tracker won't start up properly

Smarter shutdowns at night
-Run a chron job to shutdown everything at night and start everything in the morning
