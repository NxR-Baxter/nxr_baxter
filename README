Check if skeleton tracker is starting up properly
-Done, now we are checking after a certain amount of time if the tracker is still running, then writing to a file if its not. If the startup service in rc.local sees a 1, it runs sudo service udev reload, then writes a 0. Need to make sure drivers are shut down before dont this whic is not the case.

Crane game with Cartesian space controls and orientation DOWN, no roll, 90degree down pitch, no yaw.
-Pose stuff does not work. Instead, lets use IK services to find joint values for crane game and solve those.



Longer-term
Smarter handling of Kinect
-Shut down kinect or skeleton tracker entirely if no one is nearby
-Use headcam or other webcam to detect changes in scene (a.k.a.) people nearby
-Then start back up, only do "full restart" of kinect if skeleton tracker won't start up properly

Smarter shutdowns at night
-Run a chron job to shutdown everything at night and start everything in the morning
