Things that need to be done for Baxter

Fix shutdown and restart of kinect
-Hearbeat message on the skeleton tracker

Meta-mode controller
-Service-based to change the mode, publishes a latched topic whenever mode is changed
-Modes are things like: baxter shutdown motors, baxter turn on motors, etc.

"Low-Pass filter" for hand raise to trigger baxter
-Wait ~0.5-1s and see if hand is raised the whole time

Have motors turn off in a 'better' position

Speed up process of getting into each demo
-Remove 'clicking' of gripper etc

Longer-term
Smarter handling of Kinect
-Shut down kinect or skeleton tracker entirely if no one is nearby
-Use headcam or other webcam to detect changes in scene (a.k.a.) people nearby
-Then start back up, only do "full restart" of kinect if skeleton tracker won't start up properly

Smarter shutdowns at night
-Run a chron job to shutdown everything at night and start everything in the morning
