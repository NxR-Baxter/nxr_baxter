Things that need to be done for Baxter

More testing!

- May need to include something to check if the skeleton tracker can't start up properly. It may also just reset on its own, not sure.

- Do everything with MOVEIT.
-- Starting this now.
-- Should be able to test with crane setup now.

- Maybe replace crane game with memory game for now

-More modular? Crane prep and crane-go modes for example?

- Weird slow-down mode



Longer-term
Smarter handling of Kinect
-Shut down kinect or skeleton tracker entirely if no one is nearby
-Use headcam or other webcam to detect changes in scene (a.k.a.) people nearby
-Then start back up, only do "full restart" of kinect if skeleton tracker won't start up properly

Smarter shutdowns at night
-Run a chron job to shutdown everything at night and start everything in the morning
